# Fiject
Object-oriented, two-stage PDF figure generators in Python.

Gives an answer to *"How can I change the look of a figure without re-computing its data?"* which isn't possible in
`matplotlib` nor `seaborn`.

## Features
- Two-stage figure generation:
  - **Addition stage:** Incrementally add data to figure objects, rather than needing to do it all at once along with
                        visual parameters. Data caching allows skipping this step when a figure needs to be reformatted but not recomputed.
  - **Commit stage:** Format the data stored in a figure object, with a simple interface that hides the complexities of `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Supported figure types:
  - `LineGraph`: points connected by lines.
  - `Bars`: bar plot on a categorical axis.
  - `MultiHistogram`: one or more histograms on the same numerical axis. Can also be committed to box plots.
  - `ScatterPlot`: unconnected points.
  - `Table`: LaTeX tables with hierarchical rows and hierarchical columns, column stylisation (e.g. rounding, min/max bolding, ...) and borders where you need them.

## Example
Let's say you have a machine learning project where a classifier called `model` is trained and then evaluated on precision (Pr), 
recall (Re) and F1 score, for 5 different values of a hyperparameter *h*. You would do your experiments as follows:
```python
from fiject import LineGraph, CacheMode

g = LineGraph("project-results", caching=CacheMode.IF_MISSING)
if g.needs_computation:
    h_values = [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0]
    for h in h_values:
        # ...
        # model.trainModel(h)  # Takes hours to compute. We don't want to repeat it just to reformat the graph!
        # pr, re, f1 = model.evaluateYourModel()
        # ...
        g.add("Pr",    h, pr)
        g.add("Re",    h, re)
        g.add("$F_1$", h, f1)
              
g.commit(aspect_ratio=(4,3), y_lims=(0, 100), x_tickspacing=0.1, y_tickspacing=10,
         x_label="Hyperparameter value", y_label="Binary classification performance [\\%]")
```
A PDF `project-results_0.pdf` will appear, and the data will be cached in a file `project-results_0.json`.

Notice that the `CacheMode` along with the check `if g.needs_computation` will ensure that you don't
have to redo your computation if you don't like the way your figure came out the first time. You can
just change the parameters to `g.commit()` and re-run *the same code* to get a new PDF `project-results_1.pdf`
instantly.

## Installation
You can install `fiject` as any other package, or as a developer if you want to tinker with the source yourself.

### Normal install
Open a terminal and run:
```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/bauwenst/fiject.git
```
Note that although the package's source code resides in the subdirectory `src/fiject/`, there is no need to mention this
anywhere (not by you in the above command, and not even by me internally) because `pip` is smart enough to figure this
out itself. You hence do *not* need to add a `#subdirectory` argument (despite [the docs saying you do](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/#url-fragments)).

### Developer install
Open a terminal and, instead of the above, run:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/bauwenst/fiject.git
cd fiject
pip install -e .
```
The last command will detect the `pyproject.toml` file (`pip install`), look for the `fiject/__init__.py` file in the 
current directory (`.`), and put a symlink to this folder in Python's `site-packages` folder (`-e`). This means that
when you `import fiject`, it is imported from the current folder and hence any changes you make here are applied immediately.

### Troubleshooting
If, on a commit, you get an error that includes the text `This is pdfTeX` and under it something along the lines of
```
! LaTeX Error: File `type1cm.sty' not found.
```
you are likely on Linux Ubuntu and want to run
```shell
sudo apt install dvipng texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended cm-super
```

## Credit
This package was developed over the span of multiple years (2021-2023) and across multiple research papers at university.
If you produce figures for your own reports with this package, please be a kind human and acknowledge my work by crediting
this repository in a footnote. For example, in LaTeX: 
```latex
\footnote{All figures were made using Fiject (\url{https://github.com/bauwenst/fiject}), 
          a Python package by ir.\ Thomas Bauwens.}
```

## Showcase
A collage of all the figures I have drawn with this code across many university projects.

The point is not how these figures look visually; you can produce equivalent plots with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. 
The point is rather that the computation required to get the data in these graphs was extensive, and hence *tweaking* 
the visual parameters of these graphs would be equally expensive in `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. Also note how the graphs
originate from a variety of applications, showing that `fiject` comes in handy for many different domains.
